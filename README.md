# Generating Images Using Generative Deep Learning
## How batch and window sizes affect image quality in Swin Transformer GANs

This is my university undergraduate dissertation on the use of Swin Transformer GANs and how batch size and window size affects generated image quality.

The project was undertaken on the Viking Cluster, which is a high performance compute facility provided by the University of York. I am grateful for the computational support from the University of York High Performance Computing service, Viking and the Research Computing team.

### Results

#### Hand-picked generated images from a set of 5000 images
